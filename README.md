# Graph Database Prototyping Tool
To create a good graph db it is difficult to decide the layout of nodes and relationships. What should be a node, and what should be a node property? What node types work best, what relationship labels make sense?

### Goals
Aim is to provide a UI that functions intuitively and flexibly to allow the user to play around with these decisions, and more, and help them design a schema for their graph db based on their own data requirements.
Provide a mechanism to implement the schema within a data ingestion tool
